# Loan-Prediction
Loan Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict loan approval based on various applicant details. Using a cleaned dataset, the model helps financial institutions make data-driven decisions for granting loans.

Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key patterns in loan approval.
Machine Learning Model: Implemented and evaluated different models to predict loan approval.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessed accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
Dataset
The dataset used is cleaned_loan_approval_dataset.csv, which includes features like applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and more.
